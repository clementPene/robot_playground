        """
        Adds a cost to penalize contact forces that go outside a predefined range.

        This cost defines a "safe zone" for the 6D contact forces (linear and angular).
        It is more flexible than tracking a single reference force, making it ideal for
        dynamic movements where forces naturally vary. It prevents physically unrealistic
        scenarios, such as the foot pulling on the ground (negative normal force) or
        excessive torques that would cause the foot to tilt.

        Mathematical Formulation:
            The cost penalizes any component of the force vector `f` that violates its bounds.
            Let `l` be the lower_bounds and `u` be the upper_bounds. The cost is zero
            if `l <= f <= u` (component-wise). Otherwise, it grows quadratically.
            For any component `f_i` of the force vector:
                - cost(f_i) = 0                  if l_i <= f_i <= u_i
                - cost(f_i) = 0.5 * (f_i - u_i)^2 if f_i > u_i
                - cost(f_i) = 0.5 * (l_i - f_i)^2 if f_i < l_i
            This is achieved using an `ActivationModelQuadraticBarrier` in Crocoddyl.

            contact_ids (list[int]): A list of frame IDs for the contacts to be constrained.
